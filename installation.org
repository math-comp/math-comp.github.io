The Mathematical Components libraries are provided as separate packages:

- The base libraries are the libraries that support the formalization
  of the Four Color Theorem and of the Odd Order Theorem.

- Other libraries contain extensions and applications.

The installation of Mathematical Components is best done using [[https://opam.ocaml.org/][opam]], a
package manager for [[https://ocaml.org/][OCaml]], the programming language with which [[https://coq.inria.fr/][Coq]] is
implemented.

The relevant packages can be found in the [[https://coq.inria.fr/opam/www/][Coq package index]];
their name is usually prefixed with ~coq-mathcomp-~.

* Install the Base Mathematical Components Libraries

** Installation using the [[https://opam.ocaml.org/][opam]] package manager

- Using opam, the installation of the base Mathematical Components
  library is as simple as this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect
#+END_SRC

- Other base mathematical components libraries can then be installed
  similarly using ~opam install~:
  + ~coq-mathcomp-algebra~,
  + ~coq-mathcomp-field~,
  + ~coq-mathcomp-solvable~,
  + ~coq-mathcomp-fingroup~,
  + ~coq-mathcomp-character~.

** Installation using the [[https://github.com/coq/platform][Coq platform]]

- The [[https://github.com/coq/platform][Coq platform]] is a distribution of [[https://coq.inria.fr/][Coq]] together with a selection of libraries
  including most Mathematical Components libraries. It supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.

** Other installation instructions and details

- You can find more detailed installation instructions in [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/blob/master/INSTALL.md][INSTALL.md]]
  (from the official distribution), this includes:
  + various ways of installing using ~opam~
  + installation from the source files (using ~make~)
  + installation using nix

- Installation instructions in [[https://staff.aist.go.jp/reynald.affeldt/ssrcoq/install.html][Japanese, 日本語]]
  + see「パッケージからの設定」for installation using ~opam~

- Advanced: Installation Instructions for Windows 11 using cygwin-opam or WSL
  + It is possible to install the Mathematical Components libraries on
    Windows 11 using [[https://www.cygwin.com/][cygwin]] together with the binary distribution of Coq
    or together with [[https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/installation/][opam for Windows]], or with Windows Subsystem for
    Linux, as explained for example [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/mathcomp-install/blob/master/install-windows-en.org][here]].

* Install Other Mathematical Components Libraries
