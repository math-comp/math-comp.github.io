* Install the Base Mathematical Components Libraries

- The installation of Mathematical Components is best done using [[https://opam.ocaml.org/][opam]],
  a package manager for [[https://ocaml.org/][OCaml]], the programming language with which [[https://coq.inria.fr/][Coq]]
  is implemented.
- Using opam, the installation of the base Mathematical Components
  library is as simple as this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect
#+END_SRC

- Other base mathematical components libraries can be installed
  similarly using ~opam install~. The available packages can be found
  in the [[https://coq.inria.fr/opam/www/][Coq package index]]:
  + ~coq-mathcomp-algebra~,
  + ~coq-mathcomp-field~,
  + ~coq-mathcomp-solvable~,
  + ~coq-mathcomp-fingroup~

- You can find more detailed installation instructions in [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/blob/master/INSTALL.md][INSTALL.md]]
  (from the official distribution), this includes:
  + various ways of installing using ~opam~
  + installation from the source files (using ~make~)
  + installation is also possible using nix

** Installation Instructions in Other Languages

- Installation instructions in [[https://staff.aist.go.jp/reynald.affeldt/ssrcoq/install.html][Japanese, 日本語]]
  + see「パッケージからの設定」for installation using ~opam~

** Installation Instructions for Windows 10 & 11

- It is possible to install the Mathematical Components libraries on
  Windows 10 & 11 using [[https://www.cygwin.com/][cygwin]] together with the binary distribution of Coq
  or together with [[https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/installation/][opam for Windows]], or with Windows Subsystem for
  Linux, as explained for example [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/mathcomp-install/blob/master/install-windows-en.org][here]]

* Other Mathematical Components Libraries

There are already several libraries that build on top of the base
Mathematical Components libraries:

1. [[https://github.com/math-comp/fourcolor][The Four Color theorem]]
   - Available as the opam package ~coq-fourcolor~
2. [[https://github.com/math-comp/odd-order][The Odd Order theorem]]
   - Available as the opam package ~coq-mathcomp-odd-order~
3. [[https://github.com/math-comp/analysis][MathComp Analysis]]
   - Available as the opam package ~coq-mathcomp-analysis~
4. [[https://github.com/math-comp/Abel][Abel-Ruffini theorem]]
   - Available as the opam package ~coq-mathcomp-abel~
5. [[https://github.com/math-comp/real-closed][Theorems for Real Closed Fields]]
   - Available as the opam package ~coq-mathcomp-real-closed~
6. [[https://github.com/math-comp/finmap][Finite sets, finite maps, multisets and generic sets]]
   - Available as the opam package ~coq-mathcomp-finmap~
7. See the Mathematical Components' [[https://github.com/math-comp][github]] for more libraries.
   [[https://github.com/coq-community][coq-community]] also features a number of libraries using Mathematical Components.
