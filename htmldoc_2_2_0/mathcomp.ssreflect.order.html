<div class="doc">                   Types equipped with order relations

 NB: See CONTRIBUTING.md for an introduction to HB concepts and commands.

 This files defines types equipped with order relations.

<a id="lab37"></a><h1 class="section">How to use orders in MathComp?</h1>

 Use one of the following modules implementing different theories (all
 located in the module Order):
   Order.LTheory: partially ordered types and lattices excluding complement
                  and totality related theorems
   Order.CTheory: complemented lattices including Order.LTheory
   Order.TTheory: totally ordered types including Order.LTheory
    Order.Theory: ordered types including all of the above theory modules
 To access the definitions, notations, and the theory from, say,
 "Order.Xyz", insert "Import Order.Xyz." at the top of your scripts.

 In order to reason about abstract orders, notations are accessible by
 opening the scope "order_scope" bound to the delimiting key "O"; however,
 when dealing with another notation scope providing order notations for
 a concrete instance (e.g., "ring_scope"), it is not recommended to open
 "order_scope" at the same time.

<a id="lab38"></a><h1 class="section">Interfaces</h1>

 Before providing the list of interfaces, a word is necessary about
"displays". Each generic partial order has, as a first argument, a display
 to control the printing of notations. For example, when m and n are of
 type natdvd (an alias of nat), (Order.le m n) is displayed m %| n; natdvd
 is associated to the display dvd_display. Instantiating d with tt or an
 unknown display will lead to a default display for notations. See below
 for more details about displays.

 We provide the following interfaces for types equipped with an order:

<a id="lab39"></a><h1 class="section">Useful lemmas:</h1>

 On orderType, leP ltP ltgtP are the three main lemmas for case analysis.
 On porderType, one may use comparableP, comparable_leP, comparable_ltP,
 and comparable_ltgtP, which are the four main lemmas for case analysis.

 For x, y of type T, where T is canonically a porderType d:
            x &lt;= y &lt;-&gt; x is less than or equal to y
             x &lt; y &lt;-&gt; x is less than y (:= (y != x) &amp;&amp; (x &lt;= y))
           min x y &lt;-&gt; if x &lt; y then x else y
           max x y &lt;-&gt; if x &lt; y then y else x
            x &gt;= y &lt;-&gt; x is greater than or equal to y (:= y &lt;= x)
             x &gt; y &lt;-&gt; x is greater than y (:= y &lt; x)
   x &lt;= y ?= iff C &lt;-&gt; x is less than y, or equal iff C is true
    x &lt; y ?&lt;= if C &lt;-&gt; x is smaller than y, and strictly if C is false
           x &gt;=&lt; y &lt;-&gt; x and y are comparable (:= (x &lt;= y) || (y &lt;= x))
            x &gt;&lt; y &lt;-&gt; x and y are incomparable (:= ~~ x &gt;=&lt; y)
          f \min g &lt;-&gt; the function x |-&gt; Order.min (f x) (g x);
                       f \min g simplifies on application
          f \max g &lt;-&gt; the function x |-&gt; Order.max (f x) (g x);
                       f \max g simplifies on application

 For x, y of type T, where T is canonically a latticeType d:
           x `&amp;` y == the meet of x and y
           x `|` y == the join of x and y
 In a type T, where T is canonically a bLatticeType d:
              \bot == the bottom element
   \join_&lt;range&gt; e == iterated join of a lattice with a bottom
 In a type T, where T is canonically a tbLatticeType d:
              \top == the top element
   \meet_&lt;range&gt; e == iterated meet of a lattice with a top

 For x, y of type T, where T is canonically a cbDistrLatticeType d:
           x `\` y == the (sectional) complement of y in [\bot, x]

 For x of type T, where T is canonically a ctbDistrLatticeType d:
              ~` x == the complement of x in [\bot, \top]

 There are three distinct uses of the symbols
   &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, _ &lt;= _ ?= iff _, &gt;=&lt;, and &gt;&lt;
 in the default display: they can be 0-ary, unary (prefix), and binary
 (infix).
 0. &lt;%O, &lt;=%O, &gt;%O, &gt;=%O, &lt;?=%O, &gt;=&lt;%O, and &gt;&lt;%O stand respectively for
    lt, le, gt, ge, leif (_ &lt;= _ ?= iff _), comparable, and incomparable.
 1. (&lt; x),  (&lt;= x), (&gt; x), (&gt;= x), (&gt;=&lt; x), and (&gt;&lt; x) stand respectively
    for (&gt;%O x), (&gt;=%O x), (&lt;%O x), (&lt;=%O x), (&gt;=&lt;%O x), and (&gt;&lt;%O x).
    So (&lt; x) is a predicate characterizing elements smaller than x.
 2. (x &lt; y), (x &lt;= y), ... mean what they are expected to.
    These conventions are compatible with Haskell's,
    where ((&lt; y) x) = (x &lt; y) = ((&lt;) x y),
    except that we write &lt;%O instead of (&lt;).

 Like each generic partial order, lattice operations symbols also have a
 first argument which is the display (ranged over by d of type unit),
 the second which is the minimal structure they operate on and then the
 operands.  Here is the exhaustive l list of all such symbols for partial
 orders and lattices together with their default printed notation (as
 displayed by Check).

 For porderType T (in function_scope):
   &lt;=%O    == @Order.le          d T
   &lt;%O     == @Order.lt          d T
   &gt;=&lt;%O   == @Order.comparable  d T
   &gt;=%O    == @Order.ge          d T
   &gt;%O     == @Order.gt          d T
   &lt;?=%O   == @Order.leif        d T
   &lt;?&lt;=%O  == @Order.lteif       d T
 For latticeType T (in order_scope):
   x `&amp;` y == @Order.meet        d T x y
   x `|` y == @Order.join        d T x y
 For bLatticeType T (in order_scope):
   \bot    == @Order.bottom      d T
 For tLatticeType T (in order_scope):
   \top    == @Order.top         d T
 For cbDistrLatticeType T (in order_scope):
   x `|` y == @Order.sub         d T x y
 For ctbDistrLatticeType T (in order_scope):
   ~` x    == @Order.compl       d T x

 For porderType we provide the following operations:
   [arg min_(i &lt; i0 | P) M] == a value i : T minimizing M : R, subject to
                      the condition P (i may appear in P and M), and
                      provided P holds for i0.
   [arg max_(i &gt; i0 | P) M] == a value i maximizing M subject to P and
                      provided P holds for i0.
   [arg min_(i &lt; i0 in A) M] == an i \in A minimizing M if i0 \in A.
   [arg max_(i &gt; i0 in A) M] == an i \in A maximizing M if i0 \in A.
   [arg min_(i &lt; i0) M] == an i : T minimizing M, given i0 : T.
   [arg max_(i &gt; i0) M] == an i : T maximizing M, given i0 : T.
 with head symbols Order.arg_min and Order.arg_max
 The user may use extremumP or extremum_inP to eliminate them.

<ul class="doclist">
<li>&gt; patterns for contextual rewriting:
      leLHS := (X in (X &lt;= _)%O)%pattern
      leRHS := (X in (_ &lt;= X)%O)%pattern
      ltLHS := (X in (X &lt; _)%O)%pattern
      ltRHS := (X in (_ &lt; X)%O)%pattern
</li>
</ul>

 One may use displays either for convenience or to disambiguate between
 different structures defined on "copies" of a type (as explained below).
 We provide the following "copies" of types:
            natdvd := nat

 Existing displays are either dual_display d (where d is a display),
 dvd_display, ring_display (from algebra/ssrnum.v to change the scope of
 the usual notations to ring_scope). We also provide lexi_display and
 prod_display for lexicographic and product order respectively.

 Beware of the asymmetry of canonical structure inference. Canonical
 structure inference makes it possible to infer the display associated to a
 type (or a named copy of a type) from the name. However, it does not help
 finding the named copy when the display is provided. In this sense
 displays are merely used to inform the user and the notation mechanism of
 what the inference did; they are not additional input for the inference.

 Alternative notation displays can be defined by :
 1. declaring a new opaque definition of type unit. Using the idiom
    `Fact my_display : unit. Proof. exact: tt. Qed.`
 2. using this symbol to tag canonical porderType structures using
    `HB.instance Definition _ := isPOrder.Build my_display my_type ...`,
 3. declaring notations for the main operations of this library, by
    setting the first argument of the definition to the display, e.g.
    `Notation my_syndef_le x y := @Order.le my_display _ x y.` or
    `Notation "x &lt;=&lt; y" := @Order.lt my_display _ x y (at level ...).`
    Non overloaded notations will default to the default display.
 We suggest the user to refer to the example of natdvd (further explained
 below) as guide line example to add their own displays.

 The following notations are provided to build substructures:
 [SubChoice_isSubPOrder of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubChoice_isSubPOrder of U by &lt;: ] == porderType mixin for a subType
                          whose base type is a porderType
 [SubPOrder_isSubLattice of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubPOrder_isSubLattice of U by &lt;: ] ==
 [SubChoice_isSubLattice of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubChoice_isSubLattice of U by &lt;: ] == latticeType mixin for a subType
                          whose base type is a latticeType and whose
                          predicate's is a latticeClosed

 [SubChoice_isBSubLattice of U by &lt;: ] == blatticeType mixin for a subType
                          whose base type is a blatticeType and whose
                          predicate's is both a latticeClosed
                          and a bLatticeClosed
 [SubPOrder_isTSubLattice of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubPOrder_isTSubLattice of U by &lt;: ] ==
 [SubChoice_isTSubLattice of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubChoice_isTSubLattice of U by &lt;: ] == tlatticeType mixin for a subType
                          whose base type is a tlatticeType and whose
                          predicate's is both a latticeClosed
                          and a tLatticeClosed
 [SubPOrder_isTBSubLattice of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubPOrder_isTBSubLattice of U by &lt;: ] ==
 [SubChoice_isTBSubLattice of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubChoice_isTBSubLattice of U by &lt;: ] == tblatticeType mixin for a subType
                          whose base type is a tblatticeType and whose
                          predicate's is both a latticeClosed
                          and a tbLatticeClosed
 [SubLattice_isSubOrder of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubLattice_isSubOrder of U by &lt;: ] ==
 [SubPOrder_isSubOrder of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubPOrder_isSubOrder of U by &lt;: ] ==
 [SubChoice_isSubOrder of U by &lt;: with disp] ==
 [SubChoice_isSubOrder of U by &lt;: ] == orderType mixin for a subType whose
                          base type is an orderType
   [POrder of U by &lt;: ] == porderType mixin for a subType whose base type is
                          a porderType
    [Order of U by &lt;: ] == orderType mixin for a subType whose base type is
                          an orderType

 We provide expected instances of ordered types for bool, nat (for leq and
 and dvdn), 'I_n, 'I_n.+1 (with a top and bottom), nat for dvdn,
 T *prod[disp] T', T *lexi[disp] T', {t : T &amp; T' x} (with lexicographic
 ordering), seqprod_with d T (using product order), seqlexi_with d T
 (with lexicographic ordering), n.-tupleprod[disp] (using product order),
 n.-tuplelexi[d] T (with lexicographic ordering), on {subset[disp] T}
 (using subset order) and all possible finite type instances.
 (Use `HB.about type` to discover the instances on type.)

 In order to get a canonical order on prod, seq, tuple or set, one may
 import modules DefaultProdOrder or DefaultProdLexiOrder,
 DefaultSeqProdOrder or DefaultSeqLexiOrder,
 DefaultTupleProdOrder or DefaultTupleLexiOrder,
 and DefaultSetSubsetOrder.

 We also provide specialized versions of some theorems from path.v.

 We provide Order.enum_val, Order.enum_rank, and Order.enum_rank_in, which
 are monotonous variations of enum_val, enum_rank, and enum_rank_in
 whenever the type is porderType, and their monotonicity is provided if
 this order is total. The theory is in the module Order (Order.enum_valK,
 Order.enum_rank_inK, etc) but Order.Enum can be imported to shorten these.

 We provide an opaque monotonous bijection tagnat.sig / tagnat.rank between
 the finite types {i : 'I_n &amp; 'I_(p_ i)} and 'I_(\sum_i p_ i):
  tagnat.sig  : 'I_(\sum_i p_ i) -&gt; {i : 'I_n &amp; 'I_(p_ i)}
  tagnat.rank : {i : 'I_n &amp; 'I_(p_ i)} -&gt; 'I_(\sum_i p_ i)
  tagnat.sig1 : 'I_(\sum_i p_ i) -&gt; 'I_n
  tagnat.sig2 : forall p : 'I_(\sum_i p_ i), 'I_(p_ (tagnat.sig1 p))
  tagnat.Rank : forall i, 'I_(p_ i) -&gt; 'I_(\sum_i p_ i)

<div class="doc"> INSTANCES

  Instances on nat

  This is an example of creation of multiple instances on the same type,
 with distinct displays, on the example of natural numbers.
 We declare two distinct canonical orders:
<ul class="doclist">
<li> leq which is total, and where meet and join are minn and maxn, on nat
</li>
<li> dvdn which is partial, and where meet and join are gcdn and lcmn,
   on a "copy" of nat we name natdiv
</li>
</ul>

  The Module NatOrder defines leq as the canonical order on the type nat,
 i.e., without creating a "copy". We define and use nat_display and proceed
 like standard canonical structure declaration, except we use this display.
 We also use a single factory LeOrderMixin to instantiate three different
 canonical declarations porderType, distrLatticeType, orderType
 We finish by providing theorems to convert the operations of ordered and
 lattice types to their definition without structure abstraction.

<div class="doc"> The Module DvdSyntax introduces a new set of notations using the newly
 created display dvd_display. We first define the display as an opaque
 definition of type unit, and we use it as the first argument of the
 operator which display we want to change from the default one (here le,
 lt, dvd sdvd, meet, join, top and bottom, as well as big op notations on
 gcd and lcm). This notations will now be used for any ordered type which
 first parameter is set to dvd_display.

<div class="doc"> The Module NatDvd defines dvdn as the canonical order on NatDvd.t, which
 is abbreviated using the notation natdvd at the end of the module.
 We use the newly defined dvd_display, described above. This looks
 like standard canonical structure declaration, except we use a display and
 we declare it on a "copy" of the type.
 We first recover structures that are common to both nat and natdiv
 (eqType, choiceType, countType) through the clone mechanisms, then we use
 a single factory MeetJoinMixin to instantiate both porderType and
 distrLatticeType canonical structures, and end with top and bottom.
 We finish by providing theorems to convert the operations of ordered and
 lattice types to their definition without structure abstraction.
