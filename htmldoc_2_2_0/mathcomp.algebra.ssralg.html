 Canonical properties of the algebraic structures:
<a id="lab5"></a><h1 class="section">nmodType (additive abelian monoids):</h1>

                     0 == the zero (additive identity) of a Nmodule
                 x + y == the sum of x and y (in a Nmodule)
                x *+ n == n times x, with n in nat (non-negative), i.e.,
                          x + (x + .. (x + x)..) (n terms); x *+ 1 is thus
                          convertible to x, and x *+ 2 to x + x
        \sum_&lt;range&gt; e == iterated sum for a Zmodule (cf bigop.v)
                  e`_i == nth 0 e i, when e : seq M and M has a zmodType
                          structure
             support f == 0.-support f, i.e., [pred x | f x != 0]
         addr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under finite
                           sums (0 and x + y in S, for x, y in S)
 [SubChoice_isSubNmodule of U by &lt;: ] == nmodType mixin for a subType whose
                          base type is a nmodType and whose predicate's is
                          a nmodClosed

<a id="lab6"></a><h1 class="section">zmodType (additive abelian groups):</h1>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> x == the opposite (additive inverse) of x
</li>
</ul>
                 x - y == the difference of x and y; this is only notation
                          for x + (- y)
                x *- n == notation for - (x *+ n), the opposite of x *+ n
         oppr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under opposite
         zmod_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under zmodType
                          operations (0 and x - y in S, for x, y in S)
                          This property coerces to oppr_pred and addr_pred.
 [SubChoice_isSubZmodule of U by &lt;: ] == zmodType mixin for a subType whose
                          base type is a zmodType and whose predicate's
                          is a zmodClosed

<a id="lab7"></a><h1 class="section">SemiRing (non-commutative semirings):</h1>

                    R^c == the converse Ring for R: R^c is convertible to R
                           but when R has a canonical ringType structure
                           R^c has the converse one: if x y : R^c, then
                           x * y = (y : R) * (x : R)
                      1 == the multiplicative identity element of a Ring
                   n%:R == the ring image of an n in nat; this is just
                           notation for 1 *+ n, so 1%:R is convertible to 1
                           and 2%:R to 1 + 1
               &lt;number&gt; == &lt;number&gt;%:R with &lt;number&gt; a sequence of digits
                  x * y == the ring product of x and y
        \prod_&lt;range&gt; e == iterated product for a ring (cf bigop.v)
                 x ^+ n == x to the nth power with n in nat (non-negative),
                           i.e., x * (x * .. (x * x)..) (n factors); x ^+ 1
                           is thus convertible to x, and x ^+ 2 to x * x
         GRing.comm x y &lt;-&gt; x and y commute, i.e., x * y = y * x
           GRing.lreg x &lt;-&gt; x if left-regular, i.e., *%R x is injective
           GRing.rreg x &lt;-&gt; x if right-regular, i.e., *%R x is injective
               [char R] == the characteristic of R, defined as the set of
                           prime numbers p such that p%:R = 0 in R
                           The set [char R] has at most one element, and is
                           implemented as a pred_nat collective predicate
                           (see prime.v); thus the statement p \in [char R]
                           can be read as `R has characteristic p', while
                           [char R] =i pred0 means `R has characteristic 0'
                           when R is a field.
     Frobenius_aut chRp == the Frobenius automorphism mapping x in R to
                           x ^+ p, where chRp : p \in [char R] is a proof
                           that R has (non-zero) characteristic p
          mulr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under finite
                           products (1 and x * y in S for x, y in S)

 The Lemmas about these structures are contained in both the GRing module
 and in the submodule GRing.Theory, which can be imported when unqualified
 access to the theory is needed (GRing.Theory also allows the unqualified
 use of additive, linear, Linear, etc). The main GRing module should NOT be
 imported.
   Notations are defined in scope ring_scope (delimiter %R), except term
 and formula notations, which are in term_scope (delimiter %T).
   This library also extends the conventional suffixes described in library
 ssrbool.v with the following:
   0 -- ring 0, as in addr0 : x + 0 = x
   1 -- ring 1, as in mulr1 : x * 1 = x
   D -- ring addition, as in linearD : f (u + v) = f u + f v
   B -- ring subtraction, as in opprB : - (x - y) = y - x
   M -- ring multiplication, as in invfM : (x * y)^-1 = x^-1 * y^-1
  Mn -- ring by nat multiplication, as in raddfMn : f (x *+ n) = f x *+ n
   N -- ring opposite, as in mulNr : (- x) * y = - (x * y)
   V -- ring inverse, as in mulVr : x^-1 * x = 1
   X -- ring exponentiation, as in rmorphXn : f (x ^+ n) = f x ^+ n
   Z -- (left) module scaling, as in linearZ : f (a *: v)  = s *: f v
 The operator suffixes D, B, M and X are also used for the corresponding
 operations on nat, as in natrX : (m ^ n)%:R = m%:R ^+ n. For the binary
 power operator, a trailing "n" suffix is used to indicate the operator
 suffix applies to the left-hand ring argument, as in
   expr1n : 1 ^+ n = 1 vs. expr1 : x ^+ 1 = x.

<div class="doc">   The general form of the linearZ lemma uses some bespoke interfaces to
 allow right-to-left rewriting when a composite scaling operation such as
 conjC \; *%R has been expanded, say in a^* * f u. This redex is matched
 by using the Scale.law interface to recognize a "head" scaling operation
 h (here *%R), stow away its "scalar" c, then reconcile h c and s a, once
 s is known, that is, once the Linear.map structure for f has been found.
 In general, s and a need not be equal to h and c; indeed they need not
 have the same type! The unification is performed by the unify_map_at
 default instance for the Linear.map_for U s a h_c sub-interface of
 Linear.map; the h_c pattern uses the Scale.law structure to insure it is
 inferred when rewriting right-to-left.
   The wrap on the rhs allows rewriting f (a *: b *: u) into a *: b *: f u
 with rewrite !linearZ /= instead of rewrite linearZ /= linearZ /=.
 Without it, the first rewrite linearZ would produce
    (a *: apply (map_for_map (@check_map_at .. a f)) (b *: u)%R)%Rlin
 and matching the second rewrite LHS would bypass the unify_map_at default
 instance for b, reuse the one for a, and subsequently fail to match the
 b *: u argument. The extra wrap / unwrap ensures that this can't happen.
 In the RL direction, the wrap / unwrap will be inserted on the redex side
 as needed, without causing unnecessary delta-expansion: using an explicit
 identity function would have Coq normalize the redex to head normal, then
 reduce the identity to expose the map_for_map projection, and the
 expanded Linear.map structure would then be exposed in the result.
   Most of this machinery will be invisible to a casual user, because all
 the projections and default instances involved are declared as coercions.
