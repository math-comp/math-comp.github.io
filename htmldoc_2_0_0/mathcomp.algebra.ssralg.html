             scalable f &lt;-&gt; f of type U -&gt; V is scalable, i.e., f morphs    
                           scaling on U to scaling on V, a *: _ to a *: _   
                           U and V must both have lmodType R structures,    
                           for the same ringType R.                         
       scalable_for s f &lt;-&gt; f is scalable for scaling operator s, i.e.,     
                           f morphs a *: _ to s a _; the range of f only    
                           need to be a zmodType                            
                           The scaling operator s should be one of *:%R     
                           (see scalable, above), *%R or a combination      
                           nu \; *%R or nu \; *:%R with nu : {rmorphism _}; 
                           otherwise some of the theory (e.g., the linearZ  
                           rule) will not apply.                            
               linear f &lt;-&gt; f of type U -&gt; V is linear, i.e., f morphs      
                           linear combinations a *: u + v in U to similar   
                           linear combinations in V; U and V must both have 
                           lmodType R structures, for the same ringType R   
                        := forall a, {morph f: u v / a *: u + v}            
               scalar f &lt;-&gt; f of type U -&gt; R is a scalar function, i.e.,    
                           f (a *: u + v) = a * f u + f v                   
         linear_for s f &lt;-&gt; f is linear for the scaling operator s, i.e.,   
                           f (a *: u + v) = s a (f u) + f v                 
                           The range of f only needs to be a zmodType, but  
                           s MUST be of the form described in the           
                           scalable_for paragraph above for this predicate  
                           to type check.                                   
            lmorphism f &lt;-&gt; f is both additive and scalable                 
                           This is in fact equivalent to linear f, although 
                           somewhat less convenient to prove.               
      lmorphism_for s f &lt;-&gt; f is both additive and scalable for s           
        {linear U -&gt; V} == the interface type for linear functions, i.e., a 
                           Structure that encapsulates the linear property  
                           for functions f : U -&gt; V; both U and V must have 
                           lmodType R structures, for the same R            
             {scalar U} == the interface type for scalar functions, of type 
                           U -&gt; R where U has an lmodType R structure       
    {linear U -&gt; V | s} == the interface type for functions linear for s    
          (a *: u)%Rlin == transient forms that simplify to a *: u, a * u,  
           (a * u)%Rlin    nu a *: u, and nu a * u, respectively, and are   
       (a *:^nu u)%Rlin    created by rewriting with the linearZ lemma      
        (a *^nu u)%Rlin    The forms allows the RHS of linearZ to be matched
                           reliably, using the GRing.Scale.law structure.   
<ul class="doclist">
<li>&gt; Similarly to Ring morphisms, additive properties are specialized for    
    linear functions.                                                       

</li>
<li>&gt; Although {scalar U} is convertible to {linear U -&gt; R^o}, it does not    
    actually use R^o, so that rewriting preserves the canonical structure   
    of the range of scalar functions.                                       

</li>
<li>&gt; The generic linearZ lemma uses a set of bespoke interface structures to 
    ensure that both left-to-right and right-to-left rewriting work even in 
    the presence of scaling functions that simplify non-trivially (e.g.,    
    idfun \; *%R). Because most of the canonical instances and projections  
    are coercions the machinery will be mostly invisible (with only the     
    {linear ...} structure and %Rlin notations showing), but users should   
    beware that in (a *: f u)%Rlin, a actually occurs in the f u subterm.   

</li>
<li>&gt; The simpler linear_LR, or more specialized linearZZ and scalarZ rules   
    should be used instead of linearZ if there are complexity issues, as    
    well as for explicit forward and backward application, as the main      
    parameter of linearZ is a proper sub-interface of {linear fUV | s}.

 Finally we supply some helper notation for morphisms:

                           morphism is used heavily (e.g., the container    
                           morphism in the parametricity sections of poly

 The Lemmas about these structures are contained in both the GRing module   
 and in the submodule GRing.Theory, which can be imported when unqualified  
 access to the theory is needed (GRing.Theory also allows the unqualified   
 use of additive, linear, Linear, etc). The main GRing module should NOT be 
 imported.                                                                  
   Notations are defined in scope ring_scope (delimiter %R), except term    
 and formula notations, which are in term_scope (delimiter %T).             
   This library also extends the conventional suffixes described in library 
 ssrbool.v with the following:                                              
   0 -- ring 0, as in addr0 : x + 0 = x                                     
   1 -- ring 1, as in mulr1 : x * 1 = x                                     
   D -- ring addition, as in linearD : f (u + v) = f u + f v                
   B -- ring subtraction, as in opprB : - (x - y) = y - x                   
   M -- ring multiplication, as in invfM : (x * y)^-1 = x^-1 * y^-1         
  Mn -- ring by nat multiplication, as in raddfMn : f (x *+ n) = f x *+ n   
   N -- ring opposite, as in mulNr : (- x) * y = - (x * y)                  
   V -- ring inverse, as in mulVr : x^-1 * x = 1                            
   X -- ring exponentiation, as in rmorphXn : f (x ^+ n) = f x ^+ n         
   Z -- (left) module scaling, as in linearZ : f (a *: v)  = s *: f v       
 The operator suffixes D, B, M and X are also used for the corresponding    
 operations on nat, as in natrX : (m ^ n)%:R = m%:R ^+ n. For the binary    
 power operator, a trailing "n" suffix is used to indicate the operator     
 suffix applies to the left-hand ring argument, as in                       
   expr1n : 1 ^+ n = 1 vs. expr1 : x ^+ 1 = x.

<div class="doc">
   The general form of the linearZ lemma uses some bespoke interfaces to   
 allow right-to-left rewriting when a composite scaling operation such as  
 conjC \; *%R has been expanded, say in a^* * f u. This redex is matched   
 by using the Scale.law interface to recognize a "head" scaling operation  
 h (here *%R), stow away its "scalar" c, then reconcile h c and s a, once  
 s is known, that is, once the Linear.map structure for f has been found.  
 In general, s and a need not be equal to h and c; indeed they need not    
 have the same type! The unification is performed by the unify_map_at      
 default instance for the Linear.map_for U s a h_c sub-interface of        
 Linear.map; the h_c pattern uses the Scale.law structure to insure it is  
 inferred when rewriting right-to-left.                                    
   The wrap on the rhs allows rewriting f (a *: b *: u) into a *: b *: f u 
 with rewrite !linearZ /= instead of rewrite linearZ /= linearZ /=.        
 Without it, the first rewrite linearZ would produce                       
    (a *: apply (map_for_map (@check_map_at .. a f)) (b *: u)%R)%Rlin      
 and matching the second rewrite LHS would bypass the unify_map_at default 
 instance for b, reuse the one for a, and subsequently fail to match the   
 b *: u argument. The extra wrap / unwrap ensures that this can't happen.  
 In the RL direction, the wrap / unwrap will be inserted on the redex side 
 as needed, without causing unnecessary delta-expansion: using an explicit 
 identity function would have Coq normalize the redex to head normal, then 
 reduce the identity to expose the map_for_map projection, and the         
 expanded Linear.map structure would then be exposed in the result.        
   Most of this machinery will be invisible to a casual user, because all  
 the projections and default instances involved are declared as coercions.
