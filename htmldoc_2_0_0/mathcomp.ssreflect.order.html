<a id="lab37"></a><h1 class="section">How to use orders in MathComp?</h1>

 Use one of the following modules implementing different theories (all      
 located in the module Order):                                              
   Order.LTheory: partially ordered types and lattices excluding complement 
                  and totality related theorems                             
   Order.CTheory: complemented lattices including Order.LTheory             
   Order.TTheory: totally ordered types including Order.LTheory             
    Order.Theory: ordered types including all of the above theory modules   
 To access the definitions, notations, and the theory from, say,            
 "Order.Xyz", insert "Import Order.Xyz." at the top of your scripts.        
 Notations are accessible by opening the scope "order_scope" bound to the   
 delimiting key "O".                                                        

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab38"></a><h1 class="section">Interfaces</h1>

 Before providing the list of interfaces, a word is necessary about         
"displays". Each generic partial order has, as a first argument, a display  
 to control the printing of notations. For example, when m and n are of     
 type natdvd (an alias of nat), (Order.le m n) is displayed m %| n; natdvd  
 is associated to the display dvd_display. Instantiating d with tt or an    
 unknown display will lead to a default display for notations. See below    
 for more details about displays.

 On orderType, leP ltP ltgtP are the three main lemmas for case analysis.   
 On porderType, one may use comparableP, comparable_leP, comparable_ltP,    
 and comparable_ltgtP, which are the four main lemmas for case analysis.

 There are three distinct uses of the symbols                               
   &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, _ &lt;= _ ?= iff _, &gt;=&lt;, and &gt;&lt;                               
 in the default display: they can be 0-ary, unary (prefix), and binary      
 (infix).                                                                   
 0. &lt;%O, &lt;=%O, &gt;%O, &gt;=%O, &lt;?=%O, &gt;=&lt;%O, and &gt;&lt;%O stand respectively for     
    lt, le, gt, ge, leif (_ &lt;= _ ?= iff _), comparable, and incomparable.   
 1. (&lt; x),  (&lt;= x), (&gt; x), (&gt;= x), (&gt;=&lt; x), and (&gt;&lt; x) stand respectively   
    for (&gt;%O x), (&gt;=%O x), (&lt;%O x), (&lt;=%O x), (&gt;=&lt;%O x), and (&gt;&lt;%O x).      
    So (&lt; x) is a predicate characterizing elements smaller than x.         
 2. (x &lt; y), (x &lt;= y), ... mean what they are expected to.                  
    These conventions are compatible with Haskell's,                        
    where ((&lt; y) x) = (x &lt; y) = ((&lt;) x y),                                  
    except that we write &lt;%O instead of (&lt;).

 Like each generic partial order, lattice operations symbols also have a    
 first argument which is the display (ranged over by d of type unit),       
 the second which is the minimal structure they operate on and then the     
 operands.  Here is the exhaustive l list of all such symbols for partial   
 orders and lattices together with their default printed notation (as       
 displayed by Check).

   [arg min(i &lt; i0 | P) M] == a value i : T minimizing M : R, subject to   
                      the condition P (i may appear in P and M), and        
                      provided P holds for i0.

 Existing displays are either dual_display d (where d is a display),        
 dvd_display, ring_display (from algebra/ssrnum.v to change the scope of    
 the usual notations to ring_scope). We also provide lexi_display and       
 prod_display for lexicographic and product order respectively.             

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Beware of the asymmetry of canonical structure inference. Canonical        
 structure inference makes it possible to infer the display associated to a 
 type (or a named copy of a type) from the name. However, it does not help  
 finding the named copy when the display is provided. In this sense         
 displays are merely used to inform the user and the notation mechanism of  
 what the inference did; they are not additional input for the inference.   

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Alternative notation displays can be defined by :                          
 1. declaring a new opaque definition of type unit. Using the idiom

 2. using this symbol to tag canonical porderType structures using          
    `HB.instance Definition _ := isPOrder.Build my_display my_type ...`,    
 3. declaring notations for the main operations of this library, by         
    setting the first argument of the definition to the display, e.g.       
    `Notation my_syndef_le x y := @Order.le my_display _ x y.` or           
    `Notation "x &lt;=&lt; y" := @Order.lt my_display _ x y (at level ...).`      
    Non overloaded notations will default to the default display.           
 We suggest the user to refer to the example of natdvd (further explained   
 below) as guide line example to add their own displays.

 We provide expected instances of ordered types for bool, nat (for leq and  
 and dvdn), 'I_n, 'I_n.+1 (with a top and bottom), nat for dvdn,            
 T *prod[disp] T', T *lexi[disp] T', {t : T &amp; T' x} (with lexicographic     
 ordering), seqprod_with d T (using product order), seqlexi_with d T        
 (with lexicographic ordering), n.-tupleprod[disp] (using product order),   
 n.-tuplelexi[d] T (with lexicographic ordering), on {subset[disp] T}       
 (using subset order) and all possible finite type instances.               
 (Use `HB.about type` to discover the instances on type.)                   

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 In order to get a canonical order on prod, seq, tuple or set, one may      
 import modules DefaultProdOrder or DefaultProdLexiOrder,                   
 DefaultSeqProdOrder or DefaultSeqLexiOrder,                                
 DefaultTupleProdOrder or DefaultTupleLexiOrder,                            
 and DefaultSetSubsetOrder.                                                 

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 We also provide specialized versions of some theorems from path.v.         

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 We provide Order.enum_val, Order.enum_rank, and Order.enum_rank_in, which  
 are monotonous variations of enum_val, enum_rank, and enum_rank_in         
 whenever the type is porderType, and their monotonicity is provided if     
 this order is total. The theory is in the module Order (Order.enum_valK,   
 Order.enum_rank_inK, etc) but Order.Enum can be imported to shorten these. 

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 We provide an opaque monotonous bijection tagnat.sig / tagnat.rank between 
 the finite types {i : 'I_n &amp; 'I(p i)} and 'I(\sum_i p i):              
  tagnat.sig  : 'I(\sum_i p i) -&gt; {i : 'I_n &amp; 'I(p i)}                  
  tagnat.rank : {i : 'I_n &amp; 'I(p i)} -&gt; 'I(\sum_i p i)                  
  tagnat.sig1 : 'I(\sum_i p i) -&gt; 'I_n                                    
  tagnat.sig2 : forall p : 'I(\sum_i p i), 'I(p (tagnat.sig1 p))        
  tagnat.Rank : forall i, 'I(p i) -&gt; 'I(\sum_i p i)

  Instances on nat  
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

  This is an example of creation of multiple instances on the same type,     
 with distinct displays, on the example of natural numbers.                 
 We declare two distinct canonical orders:                                  
<ul class="doclist">
<li> leq which is total, and where meet and join are minn and maxn, on nat    

</li>
<li> dvdn which is partial, and where meet and join are gcdn and lcmn,        
   on a "copy" of nat we name natdiv                                         
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

  The Module NatOrder defines leq as the canonical order on the type nat,    
 i.e., without creating a "copy". We define and use nat_display and proceed 
 like standard canonical structure declaration, except we use this display. 
 We also use a single factory LeOrderMixin to instantiate three different   
 canonical declarations porderType, distrLatticeType, orderType             
 We finish by providing theorems to convert the operations of ordered and   
 lattice types to their definition without structure abstraction.

 The Module DvdSyntax introduces a new set of notations using the newly   
 created display dvd_display. We first define the display as an opaque    
 definition of type unit, and we use it as the first argument of the      
 operator which display we want to change from the default one (here le,  
 lt, dvd sdvd, meet, join, top and bottom, as well as big op notations on 
 gcd and lcm). This notations will now be used for any ordered type which 
 first parameter is set to dvd_display.

<div class="doc">
 The Module NatDvd defines dvdn as the canonical order on NatDvd.t, which   
 is abbreviated using the notation natdvd at the end of the module.         
 We use the newly defined dvd_display, described above. This looks          
 like standard canonical structure declaration, except we use a display and 
 we declare it on a "copy" of the type.                                     
 We first recover structures that are common to both nat and natdiv         
 (eqType, choiceType, countType) through the clone mechanisms, then we use  
 a single factory MeetJoinMixin to instantiate both porderType and          
 distrLatticeType canonical structures, and end with top and bottom.        
 We finish by providing theorems to convert the operations of ordered and   
 lattice types to their definition without structure abstraction.
