<a id="lab4"></a><h1 class="section">Zmodule (additive abelian groups):</h1>

              zmodType == interface type for Zmodule structure.             
 ZmodMixin addA addC add0x addNx == builds the mixin for a Zmodule from the 
                          algebraic properties of its operations.           
          ZmodType V m == packs the mixin m to build a Zmodule of type      
                          zmodType. The carrier type V must have a          
                          choiceType canonical structure.                   
 [zmodType of V for S] == V-clone of the zmodType structure S: a copy of S  
                          where the sort carrier has been replaced by V,    
                          and which is therefore a zmodType structure on V. 
                          The sort carrier for S must be convertible to V.  
       [zmodType of V] == clone of a canonical zmodType structure on V.     
                          Similar to the above, except S is inferred, but   
                          possibly with a syntactically different carrier.  
                     0 == the zero (additive identity) of a Zmodule.        
                 x + y == the sum of x and y (in a Zmodule).                
<ul class="doclist">
<li> x == the opposite (additive inverse) of x.             

</li>
</ul>
                 x - y == the difference of x and y; this is only notation  
                          for x + (- y).                                    
                x *+ n == n times x, with n in nat (non-negative), i.e.,    
                          x + (x + .. (x + x)..) (n terms); x *+ 1 is thus  
                          convertible to x, and x *+ 2 to x + x.            
                x *- n == notation for - (x *+ n), the opposite of x *+ n.  
        \sum&lt;range&gt; e == iterated sum for a Zmodule (cf bigop.v).          
                  e`_i == nth 0 e i, when e : seq M and M has a zmodType    
                          structure.                                        
             support f == 0.-support f, i.e., [pred x | f x != 0].          
         oppr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under opposite. 
         addr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under finite    
                           sums (0 and x + y in S, for x, y in S).          
         zmod_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under zmodType  
                          operations (0 and x - y in S, for x, y in S).     
                          This property coerces to oppr_pred and addr_pred. 
         OpprPred oppS == packs oppS : oppr_closed S into an opprPred S     
                          interface structure associating this property to  
                          the canonical pred_key S, i.e. the k for which S  
                          has a Canonical keyed_pred k structure (see file  
                          ssrbool.v).                                       
         AddrPred addS == packs addS : addr_closed S into an addrPred S     
                          interface structure associating this property to  
                          the canonical pred_key S (see above).             
         ZmodPred oppS == packs oppS : oppr_closed S into an zmodPred S     
                          interface structure associating the zmod_closed   
                          property to the canonical pred_key S (see above), 
                          which must already be an addrPred.                
 [zmodMixin of M by &lt;: ] == zmodType mixin for a subType whose base type is  
                          a zmodType and whose predicate's canonical        
                          pred_key is a zmodPred.                           
&gt; Coq can be made to behave as if all predicates had canonical zmodPred  
     keys by executing Import DefaultKeying GRing.DefaultPred. The required 
     oppr_closed and addr_closed assumptions will be either abstracted,     
     resolved or issued as separate proof obligations by the ssreflect      
     plugin abstraction and Prop-irrelevance functions.                     
<a id="lab5"></a><h1 class="section">Ring (non-commutative rings):</h1>

              ringType == interface type for a Ring structure.              
 RingMixin mulA mul1x mulx1 mulDx mulxD == builds the mixin for a Ring from 
                           the algebraic properties of its multiplicative   
                           operators; the carrier type must have a zmodType 
                           structure.                                       
           RingType R m == packs the ring mixin m into a ringType.          
                    R^c == the converse Ring for R: R^c is convertible to R 
                           but when R has a canonical ringType structure    
                           R^c has the converse one: if x y : R^c, then     
                           x * y = (y : R) * (x : R).                       
  [ringType of R for S] == R-clone of the ringType structure S.             
        [ringType of R] == clone of a canonical ringType structure on R.    
                      1 == the multiplicative identity element of a Ring.   
                   n%:R == the ring image of an n in nat; this is just      
                           notation for 1 *+ n, so 1%:R is convertible to 1 
                           and 2%:R to 1 + 1.                               
               &lt;number&gt; == &lt;number&gt;%:R with &lt;number&gt; a sequence of digits   
                  x * y == the ring product of x and y.                     
        \prod&lt;range&gt; e == iterated product for a ring (cf bigop.v).        
                 x ^+ n == x to the nth power with n in nat (non-negative), 
                           i.e., x * (x * .. (x * x)..) (n factors); x ^+ 1 
                           is thus convertible to x, and x ^+ 2 to x * x.   
         GRing.sign R b := (-1) ^+ b in R : ringType, with b : bool.        
                           This is a parsing-only helper notation, to be    
                           used for defining more specific instances.       
         GRing.comm x y &lt;-&gt; x and y commute, i.e., x * y = y * x.           
           GRing.lreg x &lt;-&gt; x if left-regular, i.e., *%R x is injective.    
           GRing.rreg x &lt;-&gt; x if right-regular, i.e., *%R x is injective.   
               [char R] == the characteristic of R, defined as the set of   
                           prime numbers p such that p%:R = 0 in R. The set 
                           [char R] has at most one element, and is         
                           implemented as a pred_nat collective predicate   
                           (see prime.v); thus the statement p \in [char R] 
                           can be read as `R has characteristic p', while   
                           [char R] =i pred0 means `R has characteristic 0' 
                           when R is a field.                               
     Frobenius_aut chRp == the Frobenius automorphism mapping x in R to     
                           x ^+ p, where chRp : p \in [char R] is a proof   
                           that R has (non-zero) characteristic p.          
          mulr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under finite   
                           products (1 and x * y in S for x, y in S).       
         smulr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under products 
                           and opposite (-1 and x * y in S for x, y in S).  
      semiring_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under semiring 
                           operations (0, 1, x + y and x * y in S).         
       subring_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under ring     
                           operations (1, x - y and x * y in S).            
          MulrPred mulS == packs mulS : mulr_closed S into a mulrPred S,    
        SmulrPred mulS     smulrPred S, semiringPred S, or subringPred S    
     SemiringPred mulS     interface structure, corresponding to the above  
      SubRingPred mulS     properties, respectively, provided S already has 
                           the supplementary zmodType closure properties.   
                           The properties above coerce to subproperties so, 
                           e.g., ringS : subring_closed S can be used for   
                           the proof obligations of all prerequisites.      
 [ringMixin of R by &lt;: ] == ringType mixin for a subType whose base type is  
                           a ringType and whose predicate's canonical key   
                           is a SubringPred.                                
&gt; As for zmodType predicates, Import DefaultKeying GRing.DefaultPred    
      turns unresolved GRing.Pred unification constraints into proof        
      obligations for basic closure assumptions.

 ComRingMixin mulA mulC mul1x mulDx == builds the mixin for a Ring (i.e., a

                           to reduce the number of proof obligations.       
 [comRingType of R for S] == R-clone of the comRingType structure S.

                           the boolean test for being a unit (invertible).

                           property for functions f : R -&gt; S; both R and S  
                           must have ringType structures.                   
      RMorphism morph_f == packs morph_f : rmorphism f into a Ring morphism 
                           structure of type {rmorphism R -&gt; S}.            
     AddRMorphism mul_f == packs mul_f : multiplicative f into an rmorphism 
                           structure of type {rmorphism R -&gt; S}; f must     
                           already have an {additive R -&gt; S} structure.     
  [rmorphism of f as g] == an f-clone of the rmorphism structure of g.      
       [rmorphism of f] == a clone of an existing additive structure on f.  
<ul class="doclist">
<li>&gt; If R and S are UnitRings the f also maps units to units and inverses   
     of units to inverses; if R is a field then f is a field isomorphism    
     between R and its image.                                               

</li>
<li>&gt; As rmorphism coerces to both additive and multiplicative, all          
     structures for f can be built from a single proof of rmorphism f.      

</li>
<li>&gt; Additive properties (raddf_suffix, see below) are duplicated and       
     specialised for RMorphism (as rmorph_suffix). This allows more         
     precise rewriting and cleaner chaining: although raddf lemmas will     
     recognize RMorphism functions, the converse will not hold (we cannot   
     add reverse inheritance rules because of incomplete backtracking in    
     the Canonical Projection unification), so one would have to insert a   
     /= every time one switched from additive to multiplicative rules.      

</li>
<li>&gt; The property duplication also means that it is not strictly necessary

                           f morphs a *: _ to s a _; the range of f only    
                           need to be a zmodType. The scaling operator s    
                           should be one of *:%R (see scalable, above), *%R

                           (e.g., the linearZ rule) will not apply.         
               linear f &lt;-&gt; f of type U -&gt; V is linear, i.e., f morphs      
                           linear combinations a *: u + v in U to similar

                           {scalar U} are simply notation for corresponding 
                           generic "_for" forms, Linear can be used for any

                           have an additive structure; as with Linear,

       (a *:^nu u)%Rlin    created by rewriting with the linearZ lemma. The 
        (a *^nu u)%Rlin    forms allows the RHS of linearZ to be matched    
                           reliably, using the GRing.Scale.law structure.   
<ul class="doclist">
<li>&gt; Similarly to Ring morphisms, additive properties are specialized for    
    linear functions.                                                       

</li>
<li>&gt; Although {scalar U} is convertible to {linear U -&gt; R^o}, it does not    
    actually use R^o, so that rewriting preserves the canonical structure   
    of the range of scalar functions.                                       

</li>
<li>&gt; The generic linearZ lemma uses a set of bespoke interface structures to 
    ensure that both left-to-right and right-to-left rewriting work even in 
    the presence of scaling functions that simplify non-trivially (e.g.,    
    idfun \; *%R). Because most of the canonical instances and projections  
    are coercions the machinery will be mostly invisible (with only the     
    {linear ...} structure and %Rlin notations showing), but users should   
    beware that in (a *: f u)%Rlin, a actually occurs in the f u subterm.   

</li>
<li>&gt; The simpler linear_LR, or more specialized linearZZ and scalarZ rules   
    should be used instead of linearZ if there are complexity issues, as    
    well as for explicit forward and backward application, as the main      
    parameter of linearZ is a proper sub-interface of {linear fUV | s}.

                           it is bound locally in sections where some

   D -- ring addition, as in linearD : f (u + v) = f u + f v.               
   B -- ring subtraction, as in opprB : - (x - y) = y - x.                  
   M -- ring multiplication, as in invfM : (x * y)^-1 = x^-1 * y^-1.        
  Mn -- ring by nat multiplication, as in raddfMn : f (x *+ n) = f x *+ n.  
   N -- ring opposite, as in mulNr : (- x) * y = - (x * y).                 
   V -- ring inverse, as in mulVr : x^-1 * x = 1.                           
   X -- ring exponentiation, as in rmorphX : f (x ^+ n) = f x ^+ n.         
   Z -- (left) module scaling, as in linearZ : f (a *: v)  = s *: f v.      
 The operator suffixes D, B, M and X are also used for the corresponding    
 operations on nat, as in natrX : (m ^ n)%:R = m%:R ^+ n. For the binary    
 power operator, a trailing "n" suffix is used to indicate the operator     
 suffix applies to the left-hand ring argument, as in                       
   expr1n : 1 ^+ n = 1 vs. expr1 : x ^+ 1 = x.

<div class="doc">
   The general form of the linearZ lemma uses some bespoke interfaces to   
 allow right-to-left rewriting when a composite scaling operation such as  
 conjC \; *%R has been expanded, say in a^* * f u. This redex is matched   
 by using the Scale.law interface to recognize a "head" scaling operation  
 h (here *%R), stow away its "scalar" c, then reconcile h c and s a, once  
 s is known, that is, once the Linear.map structure for f has been found.  
 In general, s and a need not be equal to h and c; indeed they need not    
 have the same type! The unification is performed by the unify_map_at      
 default instance for the Linear.map_for U s a h_c sub-interface of        
 Linear.map; the h_c pattern uses the Scale.law structure to insure it is  
 inferred when rewriting right-to-left.                                    
   The wrap on the rhs allows rewriting f (a *: b *: u) into a *: b *: f u 
 with rewrite !linearZ /= instead of rewrite linearZ /= linearZ /=.        
 Without it, the first rewrite linearZ would produce                       
    (a *: apply (map_for_map (@check_map_at .. a f)) (b *: u)%R)%Rlin      
 and matching the second rewrite LHS would bypass the unify_map_at default 
 instance for b, reuse the one for a, and subsequently fail to match the   
 b *: u argument. The extra wrap / unwrap ensures that this can't happen.  
 In the RL direction, the wrap / unwrap will be inserted on the redex side 
 as needed, without causing unnecessary delta-expansion: using an explicit 
 identity function would have Coq normalize the redex to head normal, then 
 reduce the identity to expose the map_for_map projection, and the         
 expanded Linear.map structure would then be exposed in the result.        
   Most of this machinery will be invisible to a casual user, because all  
 the projections and default instances involved are declared as coercions.
