## Tips
  
Html files pushed here are put online straight away.

Running `make` in the htmldoc directory updates the html files 
generated by coqdoc and the library graph.

Some html files are actually generated from eponymous org files
(extension `.org`). They are generated using emacs: open the
`blah.org` with emacs, press `C-c C-e h h` to generate the
corresponding `blah.html`.
