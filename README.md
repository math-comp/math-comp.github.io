By running make in htmldoc one updates the html files 
generated by coqdoc and the library graph.

Some html files are actually generated from eponymous org files
(extension `.org`). They are generated using emacs: open the file
`blah.org` with emacs, press `C-c C-e h h` to generate the
corresponding `blah.html`.
