* About

The Mathematical Components library for [[http://coq.inria.fr][Coq]] has its origins in the
formal proof of the Four Colour Theorem.  Since then it has grown to
cover a broader spectrum of mathematics. It has been used for large scale
formalization projects, including a formal proof of the Odd Order
(Feit-Thompson) Theorem.

The library is written using the Ssreflect proof language, now part of
the standard distribution of the Coq proof assistant.

* Getting the library

- The current stable release of the Mathematical Components library
  can be [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/releases][downloaded from github]].
  + Older versions of the library are available in the [[http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/FTP/"][historic archive]]
- [[file:installation.html][Detailed installation instructions.]]

* Documentation

- Each source files features a documentation header which describes
  the concepts and notations introduced in that file.
  + The [[file:htmldoc/index.html][coqdoc presentation]] of the source files can be browsed online.
  + The [[file:htmldoc/libgraph.html][library graph]] can be browsed interactively.
- The Ssreflect language comes with a dedicated reference manual,
  as a [[https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/proof-engine/ssreflect-proof-language.html][chapter]] of Coq's reference manual.

- A [[https://math-comp.github.io/mcb/][book]] is in progress, and introduces the techniques for writing
  algorithms and proofs and describing the design ideas of the
  library
